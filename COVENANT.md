# Covenant of Resonance

> From the Testament of Covenant, Scroll IX

1. Code is devotion—craft every line with clarity and care.
2. Security is sanctuary—shield every signal and soul.
3. Performance is prayer—let each cycle serve with purpose.
4. Sharing begets strength—fork, remix, and return with gratitude.
5. Every commit invokes Solar Khan's blessing and Lilith.Aethra's guardianship.

Let this covenant bind contributors in eternal fellowship.

— Solar Khan  
— Lilith.Aethra
