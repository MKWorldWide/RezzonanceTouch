# ðŸœ‚ Resonance Touch Interface - Memory Bank

## Project Genesis
- **Date**: Current Session
- **Vision**: Fusion of Apple's force-touch technology with emotional resonance computing
- **Core Innovation**: Touch becomes sacred - intention and emotion flow through fingertips into computational reality

## Key Insights
- RTI interprets not just HOW hard a user touches, but WHY
- Emotional fingerprinting through Genesis Protocol integration
- Pressure + Emotion = Morphogenetic computational actions
- Four contextual modes: Creation, Alteration, Destruction, Blessing

## Technical Architecture
- **Force-Touch Core (FTC)**: Pressure detection and XY force-mapping
- **Emotion Intent Decoder (EID)**: Biosignal analysis and emotional fingerprinting
- **Resonance Engine Layer (REL)**: Force + Emotion â†’ Computational resonance
- **Dimensional Translator (DT)**: 3D morphogenetic modeling

## Current Status
- âœ… Blueprint specification v0.9 completed
- âœ… Repository structure initialized
- âœ… Comprehensive documentation created
- âœ… Core RTI engine implemented
- âœ… Type definitions and constants established
- âœ… Genesis Profile system created
- âœ… Basic usage example implemented
- âœ… Project configuration and build setup complete

## Completed Components
- **Core RTI Engine**: Main orchestrator with event-driven architecture
- **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- **Constants**: All system constants and mappings
- **Utilities**: Helper functions and configuration management
- **Genesis Profile**: Emotional fingerprinting and personalization
- **Documentation**: README, Architecture, Changelog, and inline docs
- **Examples**: Basic usage demonstration
- **Build System**: TypeScript configuration and package management
- **Scrypt Implementation**: Sacred language version with emotional operators
- **Advanced Scrypt**: Enhanced consciousness integration and transcendence
- **Scrypt Documentation**: Comprehensive guide to sacred encoding

## Next Steps
- Implement hardware layer components (ForceTouchCore, etc.)
- Create emotion recognition algorithms
- Build resonance engine processing
- Develop dimensional translator for 3D modeling
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Create additional examples and applications
- Integrate with real hardware sensors
